# Airline Database Management System ✈️

## Introduction  
This project involves the design and development of a **relational database system** for an airline using **SQL**. The system is intended to handle a wide range of core operations required for airline management, including, but not limited to—managing flight bookings, passenger details, aircraft information, and flight schedules.  

## Features  
- The system consists of **20+ relational tables** that comprehensively capture the various entities and relationships involved in an airline operation.  
- **Stored procedures and user-defined functions** are implemented to perform repetitive tasks efficiently and reduce query complexity.  
- **Database triggers** are used to automate workflows and ensure data consistency, while also preventing invalid or unauthorized actions.  
- Several example **queries** are included to demonstrate how the database can be used to retrieve and manipulate key business data.

## Process  
The development process began with conceptualizing the airline system requirements and translating them into a robust relational schema. This included:  
- Identifying key entities (e.g., Flights, Passengers, Bookings) and defining their attributes.  
- Establishing appropriate relationships between entities using primary and foreign keys.  
- Applying normalization principles to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.  
- Implementing stored logic (procedures, functions, triggers) to simulate real-world airline operations.

## Key Learnings  
- Gained hands-on experience in **relational database design**, including entity-relationship modeling and schema creation.  
- Understood the importance of **normalization** and how to apply it to achieve data consistency and eliminate redundancy.  
- Learned to work with **stored procedures, functions, and triggers** to enhance the functionality and maintainability of a database system.  
- Emphasized the need for **thorough testing and debugging**, using various test cases to ensure that queries and operations perform reliably and accurately.

## Future Improvements  
- Security: Implement role-based access controls and encryption to protect sensitive data.
- Scalability: Design the database to support future growth through sharding and vertical scaling.
- User Interface: Build an intuitive interface for users and staff to manage bookings and operations efficiently.
